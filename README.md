# metaballs
Implementation of metaballs. Only works on Windows and with OpenCL.

# How To Build
After cloning (recursively, there are submodules), open the project in Visual Studio (it's a Visual Studio solution) and build/run it how ever you want. I recommend Debug|x86, since I haven't put much effort into making this bullet-proof enough for Release mode.

# How To Use
It's pretty easy to figure out what to do as soon as the program opens up. Just move the mouse around and watch the metaballs do their magic.
