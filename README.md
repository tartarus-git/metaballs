# metaballs
Implementation of metaballs. Only works on Windows and with OpenCL.

# How To Build
After cloning (recursively, there are submodules), open the project in Visual Studio (it's a Visual Studio solution) and build/run it how ever you want. I recommend Debug|x86/x64, since I haven't put much effort into making this bullet-proof enough for Release mode.

# How To Install
I haven't payed much attention to making the binary independent from the debugger, since this is really just a toy/demo thing. You should probably stick to running it from inside Visual Studio.

# How To Use
It's pretty easy to figure out what to do as soon as the program opens up. Just move the mouse around and watch the metaballs do their magic.
